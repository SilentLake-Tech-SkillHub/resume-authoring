# Approval, files, and versions

Read this before creating a workspace, naming a candidate, exporting a file, or claiming delivery.

## Workspace

For a new user without a layout standard, propose five shallow zones: source materials, requirement clarification, working drafts, accepted deliverables, and governance records. Translate the labels to the user's language. If a workspace exists, ask whether to retain it before moving or creating files. Keep process notes and scripts apart from accepted files; avoid nested “final/final2” shells. Name scripts for their action, not `utils` or `final`.

## Review states

1. `facts_open`: target and sources known; claims are being checked.
2. `modules_in_review`: each required module has its own approved/revise/defer status. A Word candidate follows the required approvals or an explicit in-scope review waiver, recorded with its source and round.
3. `word_candidate`: editable, versioned file built from the approved modules; render and inspect every page.
4. `word_approved_pdf_pending`: the person approves the exact Word candidate. Assign a new formal **content version** and record which candidate produced it; do not yet call the pair delivered.
5. `pdf_candidate`: export from that approved Word. Verify text, page count, visuals, fonts/icons, and ability to find/open the file.
6. `delivered`: the person approves the exact PDF and the requested Word/PDF pair. Preserve predecessor files and the candidate-to-formal mapping.

Changing facts or an approved module reopens that module and affected Word/PDF approvals **for the new revision**. Changing the Word or re-exporting it invalidates PDF acceptance for that new revision. A previously delivered pair remains historically accepted and preserved; never retroactively mark its files unapproved or overwrite them. Create new candidates and a new formal content version for the change. A pause or tool check does not advance a review state. For a one-format request, record the changed delivery contract and use only its relevant acceptance gate.

## Version and naming contract

Keep candidate and formal content versions distinguishable. If the user explicitly authorizes delivery without another review, record `authorized_delivery` and the precise waiver rather than inventing file acceptance. One possible pattern is `v1.2.0-candidate.3` for a working copy and `v1.2.0` for the approved content version; use an existing project convention when present. The candidate-to-formal promotion records source file, date, approving user, scope/language, and checks. The PDF inherits the content version but retains its own pending/approved status. Never overwrite an older accepted version to make a new one appear current.

Filenames should identify the person, language, purpose, content version, and date in the **person's private workspace**. Do not carry filenames or identity data into reusable Skill resources. Keep each language's approval independent and identify an accepted bilingual pair explicitly when needed.

## File review checklist

- Word: editable content, full text and factual comparison to approved modules, every-page render, usable fonts/icons, page count and balance, visible file in the user's file manager, and actual-user approval of the exact candidate.
- PDF: exported from that approved Word, searchable/copyable text, every-page visual review, expected page count, stable fonts/icons and pagination, visible/openable file, and separate actual-user approval.
- Delivery report: list the exact approved files, versions and source candidate, what was validated, what remains unverified in the user's native viewer, and what was not authorized (such as submission or publication).

## Length-stage and format identities

Record `long`, `compressed`, or `target_length_short` as separate purposes; keep language, source version, target pages, actual rendered pages, format baseline and review authority alongside the format approval. The long Word is the complete factual/editorial source. The compressed version retains its substantive content in shorter wording. If compression satisfies the person's agreed page requirement, it can be delivered directly; otherwise the short version records subsequent selection and deletion decisions. Read [resume-compression](../skills/resume-compression/SKILL.md) for routing and evidence.

Keep earlier filenames and bytes intact when correcting a purpose label; append a superseding registration rather than silently renaming an accepted file or changing its history. Do not rename another language or an older short version to imply it was updated. The format baseline can differ from the content source when explicitly selected: record the exact file and permitted format changes. Review waivers apply only to their stated steps and round, with authority recorded separately from actual acceptance.
